Task 7 is complete. I have implemented the MVP workflow catalog (PR Review and Lint Sweep) and verified their logical flow using the runner engine and mocked step runners.

I am ready to proceed to Task 8: Build Standalone CLI Adapter.

**Summary of completed work:**
- Implemented `packages/workflows/src/pr-review.ts`.
- Implemented `packages/workflows/src/lint-sweep.ts`.
- Implemented `packages/workflows/src/index.ts`.
- Verified integration with `packages/workflows/tests/workflows.test.ts`.
